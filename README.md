ENJOY THE WORLD OF INVESTMENT

Welcome to your personal financial advisor.
Our app puts together a portfolio of up to 3 stocks that match your individual preferences.

To start the investment experience make sure that the following files are all in the same folder:

 - financial_data_loading.py
 - business.py
 - recommendation.py
 - sustain.py

 - recommendation_df.csv
 - businiess_df.csv
 - sustain_df.csv

 - Stock Advisor App.ipynb

Stock Advisor App.ipynb is the main file of our app. 
After executing all cells, our app will open. 
On the basis of 6 questions we determine from all 500 stocks in the S&P 500 the three that best suit you.
This file already contains some comments on our approach.
